# Initiate

We're keen to show off our staff here at [Stein IAS](https://steinias.com), and what better way than a staff directory! Here's where you come in - we'd like you to build a front-end for our [staff directory API](https://interview.dev.steinias.com/api/employees)! Feel free to use whatever frameworks/languages you feel comfortable with, but note that we may ask why certain decisions were made.

There is an Adobe XD file in this repository containing the design we'd like you to follow. If you cannot open the file or would prefer to access the design online, the design specs are [available here](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/db20a554-d1de-4904-4cd1-b36db60704e4-ad11/screen/d81915ed-2e05-4cea-a9c6-8cd00c1e4204/Our-Staff/). 

- If you cannot use the Omnes font, we recommend picking a similar one from an available font library.
- We're not looking for pixel perfect, but be mindful of certain design decisions.
- Don't worry about the other nav items, they can have a '#' href.
- If you are using the online spec, image assets can be downloaded from the right side asset panel.
- There will only ever be 20 staff.
- The API is very simple and doesn't contain any filtering, so that will need to be implemented client-side.

Once you have completed the project, you can send a link to your repo (please make sure it's accessible to us) or a zip folder.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with HR or your technical contact.

Good luck!
